        I have your calendar open.

        For what date? 
        <break strength="medium"/> 
        What time would you like to start?

        Ok. I have booked the appointment for you!

        I purchased my love for money,
        there was nothing else I could get,
        sing angelic, you rasping strings,
        sing angelic of lovers yet.
        <break time="0.5s"/> 
        That dream, that never came true,
        that dream was angelic to get,
        for him, who is banished from Eden,
        is Eden an Eden yet.
